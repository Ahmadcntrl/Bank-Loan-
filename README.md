# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard
 - Project Overview
A brief summary of what the project does.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bank lending activities. It tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment status to help the bank monitor portfolio health and risk.

- Key Insights
List 3–4 high-level findings (you can use the ones I derived for you earlier):

Portfolio Health: 86.18% of loans are "Good," while 13.82% are "Bad/Charged-off."

Liquidity: The bank has received $473.1M against $435.8M funded, indicating positive cash flow.

Borrower Profiles: Long-term employees (10+ years) are the most frequent applicants, and Debt Consolidation is the primary reason for borrowing.

- Technical Skills Used

Data Cleaning: Handling null values and formatting currency/dates.

Excel Formulas/Pivot Table: Creating calculated measures for MTD (Month-To-Date) and MoM (Month-Over-Month) growth.

Data Visualization: Using Treemaps, Heatmaps, and Donut charts to tell a story.
